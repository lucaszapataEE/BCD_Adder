# BCD_Adder
This was a project for my Digital Circuits class. It adds two BCD numbers and displays the sum on a 7-segment digital display.

In BCD_Adder.pdf, you will find a full report on the logic behind the project, the development process, problems encountered and their solutions, and what I have learned. 

Other included files are several images of the circuit working, as well as the simplified circuit diagram.
